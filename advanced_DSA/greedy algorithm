Q1. Distribute Candy

Problem Description
N children are standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum number of candies you must give?

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
-109 <= A[i] <= 109

Input Format
The first and only argument is an integer array A representing the rating of children.

Output Format
Return an integer representing the minimum candies to be given.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2]
Input 2:
A = [1, 5, 2, 1]

Example Output
Output 1:
3
Output 2:
7

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
The candidate with 1 rating gets 1 candy and candidate with rating 2 cannot get 1 candy as 1 is its neighbor. 
So rating 2 candidate gets 2 candies. In total, 2 + 1 = 3 candies need to be given out.
Explanation 2:
Candies given = [1, 3, 2, 1]

Solution -

class Solution:
	# @param A : list of integers
	# @return an integer
	def candy(self, A):
        n = len(A)
        # assign 1 candy to each child
        temp = [1] * n
        # from left to right and check with previous neighbor
        for i in range(1, n):
            if A[i-1] < A[i]:
            # increase with previous neighbor
                temp[i] = temp[i-1] + 1
        temp2 = [1] * n
        # from right to left and check with next neighbor
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            if A[i] > A[i+1]:
            # increase with next neighbor
                temp2[i] = temp2[i+1] + 1
        ans = 0
        # get max from left to right and right to left
        for x, y in zip(temp, temp2):
            ans += max(x, y)
        return ans

Q2. Finish Maximum Jobs

Problem Description
There are N jobs to be done, but you can do only one job at a time.
Given an array A denoting the start time of the jobs and an array B denoting the finish time of the jobs.
Your aim is to select jobs in such a way so that you can finish the maximum number of jobs.
Return the maximum number of jobs you can finish.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] < B[i] <= 109

Input Format
The first argument is an integer array A of size N, denoting the start time of the jobs.
The second argument is an integer array B of size N, denoting the finish time of the jobs.

Output Format
Return an integer denoting the maximum number of jobs you can finish.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 5, 7, 1]
B = [7, 8, 8, 8]
Input 2:
A = [3, 2, 6]
B = [9, 8, 9]

Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:
1

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
We can finish the job in the period of time: (1, 7) and (7, 8).
Explanation 2:
Since all three jobs collide with each other. We can do only 1 job.

Solution -

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A, B):
        zipped = zip(A,B)
        zipped = list(zipped)
        # print(zipped)
        res = sorted(zipped,key = lambda x: x[1])
        # print(res)
        A,B = zip(*res)
        # print(A,B)
        count = 1
        lastEnd = B[0]

        for i in range(1,len(A)):
            if A[i] >= lastEnd:
                count += 1
                lastEnd = B[i]
        return count

Q3. Flipkart's Challenge in Effective Inventory Management

Problem Description
In the recent expansion into grocery delivery, Flipkart faces a crucial challenge in effective inventory management. Each grocery item on the platform carries its own expiration date and profit margin, represented by two arrays, A and B of size N. A[i] denotes the time left before expiration date for the ith item, and B[i] denotes profit margin for the ith item. To mitigate potential losses due to expiring items, Flipkart is seeking a strategic solution.
The objective is to identify a method to strategically buy certain items, ensuring they are sold before their expiration date, thereby maximizing overall profit. Can you assist Flipkart in developing an innovative approach to optimize their grocery inventory and enhance profitability?
Your task is to find the maximum profit one can earn by buying groceries considering that you can only buy one grocery item at a time.
NOTE:
You can assume that it takes 1 minute to buy a grocery item, so you can only buy the ith grocery item when the current time <= A[i] - 1.
You can start buying from day = 0.
Return your answer modulo 109 + 7.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
0 <= B[i] <= 109

Input Format
The first argument is an integer array A represents the deadline for buying the grocery items.
The second argument is an integer array B represents the profit obtained after buying the grocery items.

Output Format
Return an integer denoting the maximum profit you can earn.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 3, 2, 3, 3]
B = [5, 6, 1, 3, 9]
Input 2:
A = [3, 8, 7, 5]
B = [3, 1, 7, 19]

Example Output
Output 1:
20
Output 2:
30

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
At time 0, buy item with profit 5.
At time 1, buy item with profit 6.
At time 2, buy item with profit 9.
At time = 3 or after , you can't buy any item, as there is no item with deadline >= 4.
So, total profit that one can earn is 20.
Explanation 2:
At time 0, buy item with profit 3.
At time 1, buy item with profit 1.
At time 2, buy item with profit 7.
At time 3, buy item with profit 19.
We are able to buy all items within their deadline. So, total profit that one can earn is 30.

Q4. Seats

Problem Description
There is a row of seats represented by string A. Assume that it contains N seats adjacent to each other.
There is a group of people who are already seated in that row randomly. i.e. some are sitting together & some are scattered.
An occupied seat is marked with a character 'x' and an unoccupied seat is marked with a dot ('.')
Now your target is to make the whole group sit together i.e. next to each other, without having any vacant seat between them in such a way that the total number of hops or jumps to move them should be minimum.
In one jump a person can move to the adjacent seat (if available).
NOTE: 1. Return your answer modulo 107 + 3.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000000
A[i] = 'x' or '.'

Input Format
The first and only argument is a string A of size N.

Output Format
Return an integer denoting the minimum number of jumps required.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = "....x..xx...x.."
Input 2:
A = "....xxx"

Example Output
Output 1:
5
Output 2:
0

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Here is the row having 15 seats represented by the String (0, 1, 2, 3, ......... , 14) 
               . . . . x . . x x . . . x . . 
Now to make them sit together one of approaches is -
               . . . . . . x x x x . . . . .
Steps To achieve this:
1) Move the person sitting at 4th index to 6th index: Number of jumps by him =   (6 - 4) = 2
2) Bring the person sitting at 12th index to 9th index: Number of jumps by him = (12 - 9) = 3
So, total number of jumps made: 2 + 3 = 5 which is the minimum possible.
If we other ways to make them sit together but the number of jumps will exceed 5 and that will not be minimum.
Explanation 2:
They are already together. So, the cost is zero.

Solution -

class Solution:
	# @param A : string
	# @return an integer
    
	def seats(self, A):
         # Store the indexes
        MOD=10**7 + 3
        position = []
        seats=A
 
    # Stores the count of occupants
        count = 0
 
    # Length of the string
        lenn = len(seats)
 
    # Traverse the seats
        for i in range(lenn):
 
        # If current place is occupied
            if (seats[i] == 'x'):
 
            # Push the current position
            # in the vector
                position.append(i - count)
                count += 1
        # print(position)
 
    # Base Case:
        if (count == lenn or count == 0):
            return 0
 
    # The index of the median element
        med_index = (count - 1) // 2
 
    # The value of the median element
        med_val = position[med_index]
 
        ans = 0
 
    # Traverse the position[]
        for i in range(len(position)):
            
            # Update the ans
            ans = (ans % MOD +
                abs(position[i] - med_val)
                % MOD) % MOD
    
    # Return the final count
        return ans % MOD
